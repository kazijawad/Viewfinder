# Viewfinder

Viewfinder is an optical character recognition program that analyzes handwritten text and provides generated text in different writing styles.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
Python 3.6.x
OpenCV 3.4.x
Tensorflow 2.x.x
numpy 1.17.x
editdistance 0.5.x
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kazijawad/Viewfinder.git
```

2. Change directory and run the python script
```
cd src/
