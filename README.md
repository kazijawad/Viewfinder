# Viewfinder

Viewfinder is an optical character recognition program that analyzes handwritten sentences and provides generated text in the form of Shakespearean writing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
Python 3.6.x
OpenCV 4.x.x
Tensorflow 2.x.x
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kazijawad/Viewfinder.git
```

2. Change directory and run the python script
```
cd src/
python3 main.py
```
